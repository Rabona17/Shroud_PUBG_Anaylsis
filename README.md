# Shroud_PUBG_Anaylsis
This was my first project working on data-gathering and analysis. The project was done on Oct, 2018.

I web-scrapped the official site of PUBG to get most 1600 recent duo games of the famous streamer Shroud, and I make simple analysis on them using Pandas
## Techniques involved
* Web-Scraping using `Beautifulsoup` and `Json`.
* Data Cleaning using `Numpy` and `Pandas`.
* Simple `time-series` analysis and data visualization using `Matplotlib`.
